This program is an addition to a project in my repository called nodejs-meme-scraper-upleveled-2020.
What has been added? I'm glad you asked. A server with no dependencies has been built and linked to an
HTML file in the public folder. There are ten links on the webpage, and each link leads to a custom
meme, which was created using the index.js file in the public folder.

If you're interested in learning more about building a server with no dependencies, check out
this [MDN doc:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework).

You can access this program on repl.it [here](https://repl.it/@JamesSheppard1/nodejsweb-server-with-meme-scraper#README.md).
Once on the repl.it page, press the run button and the webpage will reveal itself.
